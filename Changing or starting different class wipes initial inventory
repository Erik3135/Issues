My main account was a Warrior, I then decided it would be cool to test out a different class. I did /class and played as a mage for a while. When I did /class again to play my warrior again I came to find that I had everything reset in my inventory as if I just started as a new warrior (including the unsellable Oak spear). I had full armor and many many items in my inventory so I am quite upset with this glitch. If any more information is needed I am happy to help answer as best as I can.
Thank-You,
